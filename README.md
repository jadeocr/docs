# jadeocr docs

Welcome to the documentation site repo for [jadeocr](https://jadeocr.com)!

If you are looking for the main project repository, go [here](https://github.com/jadeocr/jadeocr-next).

View the docs [here](https://docs.jadeocr.com)


## Quickstart
Here's documentation for the documentation! Make sure to have the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gastbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli) installed.

Clone the repo, then run the following to get started
```bash
gatsby develop
```

## Editing Files
Edit files in `src/docs` to edit the documentation. Files are in MDX, so use markdown!

Create new files in `src/docs` to make new pages, and make sure to edit `src/config/sidebar.yml` to have your new pages show up in the sidebar.


## Deployment
Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) using the setup for Gatsby.


## Acknowledgements
Using the [Rocket Docs](https://rocketdocs.netlify.app/) Gatsby theme.
