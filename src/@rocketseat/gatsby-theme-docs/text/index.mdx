Welcome to the documentation site for [jadeocr](https://jadeocr.com)!
Documentation is still a work-in-progress, so check back later for more
~interesting~ content!

## Nota Bene
As jadeocr-next evolves under development, so will the docs. For now, the API's
base URL will be on your local express instance, `http://localhost:3000/api`.

When you see `https://api.jadeocr.com` in the API docs, make sure to replace that
with `http://localhost:3000` in your requests.

Additionally, all API requests with a body use the `x-www-form-urlencoded` type
unless otherwise specified
