First clone the [jadeocr repository](https://github.com/jadeocr/jadeocr-next)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jadeocr/jadeocr-next
```
Then set up your environment variables in **client/.env**
```bash title=client/.env
VUE_APP_API_BASEURL="my_server_url/api"
```
Then run the following to quickly spin up a dev instance
### Web Client Setup
```bash
cd client
yarn && yarn twbuild
yarn serve # Starts dev server on http://localhost:8080
```
### Server Setup
First set up a MongoDB server (locally or on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)) then add the following to **server/.env**
```bash title=server/.env
MONGOOSEURL="my_mongoose_url_with_key"
```
On the server, make sure you have Python3 and [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python) installed. Also make sure that you have installed `virtualenv` (`pip install virtualenv`) to isolate dependencies from the rest of your system.
Then run the following
```bash
cd server

# Python setup
virtualenv venv # Creates python virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # Activates virtual environment (run each time before working with the server)
pip install --upgrade pip # Updates pip
pip install -r requirements.txt # Installs dependencies

# Start up node.js server
cd server
yarn && yarn dev # Starts dev server on http://localhost:3000

deactivate # Deactivates virtual environment (run this when you're done)
```
