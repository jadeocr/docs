The jadeocr OCR API is at the heart of what jadeocr was made to do: help language
learners practice their handwriting.


## Handwriting Recognition

The handwriting recognition API handles detecting handwriting in Simplified
Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese.

### Preparing the data
The handwriting recognition API works on a _stroke array_, which can be generated
with an HTML canvas or similar tools. Send the array as a string in the request.

Here is a sample stroke array for the character "口":

```json
[[(75,128),(83,172),(85,196)],[(84,127),(91,124),(123,121),(151,121),(161,121),(161,128),(165,157),(164,181),(162,195)],[(89,187),(103,194),(129,200),(149,199)]]
```

### Request
Send a POST request to `https://api.jadeocr.com/api/ocr` with the following body:

|       Key       |            Value            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| strokes         | myStrokeArray               |


### Response
The response contains an array of predictions from most confident to least
confident.
```json
[
    "囗",
    "口",
    "日",
    "卲",
    "叩",
    "凵",
    "乜",
    "公"
]
```
