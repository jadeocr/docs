The jadeocr user API is responsible for handling authentication and user details.


## Creating a user (signing up)

### Request
To create a user, send a POST request to `https://api.jadeocr.com/api/signup` with
the following parameters.

|       Key       |        Example Value        |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| email           | "test@test.com"             |
| firstName       | "jadeocr"                   |
| lastName        | "developer"                 |
| password        | "correcthorsebatterystaple" |
| confirmPassword | "correcthorsebatterystaple" |

### Response
If you do not get a code `200` response, then the server sends an error message
in the response.


## Authenticating (logging in)

### Request
To sign in, send a POST request to `https://api.jadeocr.com/api/signin`

|       Key       |        Example Value        |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| email           | "test@test.com"             |
| password        | "correcthorsebatterystaple" |

### Response
If you sign in successfully, you should get the `user` object, which looks
something like this. You can also get this object by using the [user basic
information](#user-basic-information) route.
```json
{
    "_id": "5fd8251c8149c1516f92345a",
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "firstName": "jadeocr",
    "lastName": "developer",
    "password": "$2a$10$BgNwN8fgPToiGFYd/V4uxu0YL9nv5lUClsw/ZFP3snpUep61Mw8j6",
    "isTeacher": false,
    "__v": 0
}
```
Otherwise, the server will send an error message in the response. When you sign
in, the server generates a cookie that is _essential_ for user-specific requests
(getting decks, joining classes, etc.).

**Note:** These docs will specify sending the cookie in the request as sending
the request "with credentials." If you receive a `401` response in a request,
not sending the cookie is the most likely reason. In
[Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), add `{ withCredentials: true }`
to the request to automatically send the cookie.


## Deauthenticating (signing out)

### Request
To sign out, send a POST request with credentials to `https://api.jadeocr.com/api/signout`.

### Response
If you have been previously authenticated, the server will send a `200` response.
Otherwise, you have not been authenticated and there is no need to sign out.


## User (basic information)
This route sends the basic user information, such as the user ID, email, name,
and teacher status. If you want to get all the information about a user, use
the [user detailed](#user-detailed-information) endpoint instead.

### Request
To get the `user` object (the same object returned by the [authentication](#authenticating-logging-in)
route `https://api.jadeocr.com/api/signin`), send a GET request with credentials to
`https://api.jadeocr.com/api/user`.

### Response
If you are authenticated, the response should look like this:
```json
{
    "_id": "5fd8251c8149c1516f92345a",
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "firstName": "jadeocr",
    "lastName": "developer",
    "password": "$2a$10$BgNwN8fgPToiGFYd/V4uxu0YL9nv5lUClsw/ZFP3snpUep61Mw8j6",
    "isTeacher": false,
    "__v": 0
}
```


## User (detailed information)
There is also a much more detailed information endpoint available, which sends
all the information associated with a user. This includes classes, decks, stats,
all quizzes, and more.

### Request
Send a GET request with credentials to `https://api.jadeocr.com/api/user/details`.

### Response
If you are authenticated, the response should look like this:

**Note:** The response can _easily_ be tens of thousands of lines long! Don't
call this route unless you need to; read the [deck](/api/deck) and [class](/api/class)
pages to learn how to get data for decks, reviews, classes, and more.
```json
{
    "classes": [
        "259395"
    ],
    "classesTeaching": [],
    "stats": [],
    "_id": "5fd8251c8149c1516f92345b",
    "id": "5fd8251c8149c1516f92345a",
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "firstName": "Tanay",
    "lastName": "Biradar",
    "password": "$2a$10$fr7gsqfkAH2gew9czPEGzOz1sg5OKjbrkQ7tp3QwU/djvv/X4TcRS",
    "isTeacher": false,
    "decks": [
        {
            "isOwner": true,
            "learned": false,
            "_id": "5fea66a4635ae125b03e7283",
            "deckId": "5fea66a4635ae125b03e727f",
            "deckName": "Midterm Vocabulary",
            "deckDescription": "Vocabulary for the DLS 2020 spring midterm",
            "latestAccessDate": 1609381463913,
            "quizAttempts": [ // an array of all quiz attempts
              ...
            ],
            "srs": [ // an array of all review attempts
              ...
            ],
            "totalQuizAttempts": 168
        }
        ...
    ],
    "__v": 274
}
```
